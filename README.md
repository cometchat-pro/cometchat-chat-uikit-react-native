# CometChat React Native UI Kit

The CometChat React Native UI Kit provides a pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into an existing or a new app.

## Prerequisites

## Getting Started
To set up CometChat React Native UI Kit and utilize CometChat for your chat functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
1. **Create an Account**: Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
